UgwR2FJib66EM_x-M6d4AaABAg,w_tCOgxXKwA,185d8bc575d797d8,"Great review, and you’re so enthusiastic and engaging. Brilliant 

I have the RWD seal for 18months now, and I absolutely love it. I have the Tahiti blue interior, which I think is so much better than the black.  ‘Only’ 308hp (in the RWD) is more than enough imo. 
The cars inbuilt Sat Nav now has google search integrated into it, so although it’s not quite as good as Google Maps, it looks awesome in portrait mode. Also, many of the cars other menus (such as the media center for radio, dab, std card, Bluetooth, and the inbuilt Spotify, look to be optimized for portrait mode. Therefore I love the fact that you can use portrait or landscape mode for the screen. 

I agree that the wireless charging isn’t that powerful, and if you’re using CarPlay, it only just keeps up with the current charge level (because CarPlay is such a heavy user of power). If you just use the car’s native system, then the phone charges quite fast. 

If you open BYD assistant, you can set your own wake word for voice control (in addition to “Hi BYD”). Also, you can enable wake word free commands (where you don’t need to say any wake word). These include ‘next track’, ‘previous track’, ‘turn on ac’, ‘turn off ac’, ‘rotate screen’, ‘route overview’, ‘end navigation’ etc. Extremely useful and more natural than having to say a wake word.",2025-11-14T10:32:02Z,23,0,,en,youtube,2026-01-13T11:54:26.529248

This is by far the best car I’ve had. A couple things to point out in response to this vid. You can change the indicator noise in the settings. You can also set the car up so that as soon as you unlock it the car starts and is ready to go and the same for when you lock the car it will power off the car. Getting familiar with this sort of thing in my Tesla was a nice addition for BYD. Only gripe is that infotainment system has freezed up on me on several occasions. The user interface seem like a cheap generic system in comparison to a Tesla for example. But still very good. The update has also improved it a lot.",2025-11-13T23:03:31Z,156,47,,en,youtube,2026-01-13T11:54:26.529272

Yeah, it's not perfect (no car is), but it really suits me.  I've done over 7k very comfortable miles in it and have no regrets.  The performance in the base model is more that sufficient, Sport mode makes it so quick, overtakes are done quicker than expected, has good space in the rear seats (my teens love the space after our Ioniq electric), and it looks great; I had a Tesla driver stop me at a Supercharger location on the outskirts of Glasgow asking what I thought about it and he said he absolutely loves it and is thinking of getting one as his next company car when the lease on his Tesla ends.

Just some things to note:
1. You can turn on auto start, so the car starts automatically after pressing the brake pedal, no need to press the glossy start/stop button. Likewise, you can enable auto stop, so the car automatically turns off when locking the car.

2. You can reduce the indicator volume, there are three settings: low, mid and high.

3. The adaptive speed can be changed in 1mph increments by holding the toggle up or down, instead of pressing it briefly.",2025-11-14T02:56:50Z,28,2,,en,youtube,2026-01-13T11:54:26.529679

The one thing I miss is a speed limiter setting - where you set a maximum speed and still have accelerator control below that speed, but it won't go above that set speed unless you mash the accelerator. BMWs have had this as standard for years. Cruise control with it's lack of control is just too lazy for me and my right foot doesn't know what to do! My few small negatives would be -  I wish the door pockets where lined so that stuff in them didn't slide around when accelerating. The centre storage lid is a bit awkward to open while driving so get your sunglasses and sweets out before you start moving! Everything else about the car is great so I get over the little first world problems 😁. One last one - the latest update to 2.0 failed on my Seal and it does nothing when I request an update, still waiting. I would go to a dealer but it's a 300 mile round trip, so yeah, I'll wait a bit longer.",2025-11-13T23:07:41Z,2,0,,en,youtube,2026-01-13T11:54:26.529776

I had a bit of a double take though when you mentioned the price of your Seal in the UK. Here in Aus, it is around A$65,000 drive away. Which converts to £32,208 based on today's exchange rate.

We've had it for about 6 months, and like you, have loved our time with it, and have zero regrets in choosing the Seal. 

The biggest minor annoyance for me is the ""design"" (?) of the front and rear cameras. I find the vision from them obscured too easily when it is raining. Maybe if the design/placement of them protected them a bit better from rain..?

UgzREcV-iMQtw5lxKVp4AaABAg,hFNE51tURBU,ee1b063338c2f2cb,"In Brazil, BYD charges around £16,400 for this car and it’s called “Dolphin Mini”. It’s currently the best-selling EV here, offering the best price-to-range ratio in our market. It also has slightly more rear seat space, and the seatbelt design seems safer than yours.

However, the battery is different. It’s a 38kWh pack with 73.5 hp. One notable omission is the pedestrian warning sound. It’s been completely removed here, and there’s no option to activate it, unlike yours, which I believe allows toggling it on or off. Personally, I see that as a safety downgrade.

We do have rear parking sensors and a 360° camera system, but some safety features were cut, like interior cameras for lane assist or driver monitoring. The extra storage compartment under the boot floor is also gone.

It’s a mix of good and bad. South America is a very important market for BYD. They even built their largest factory outside China here in Brazil, yet we still get a stripped-down version compared to Europe. It is slightly cheaper here, but still far from affordable for most of the Brazilian population.

Even in China, only poor people or those family need a backup for commuter car will consider this model. Don’t fall for all that “safety upgrade” nonsense, the car is the same. In fact, compared to the Chinese version, its intelligent driving and infotainment features are downgraded.

Let me tell you: with £18k in China, we could buy a far more advanced electric car. For those who only know German brands, BMW i3 or Audi Q4 is under this price tier. But here’s the thing: hardly anyone in China picks those anymore, because their outdated driving-assist tech and entertainment systems simply can’t compete with Chinese brands. 😂",2025-08-13T01:11:32Z,14,7,,en,youtube,2026-01-13T11:54:28.834544

UgzRKPMLWGT0UIQCA4V4AaABAg,WgyxArwhtcM,b7fc92a225f5fbde,"All your reasons to not buy this car are really quiet pathetic and uneducated. 
 - The power consumption shouldn't be reset. It is an average over 50km. If you reset it, it will need to recalibrate over the next 50km. You would want an accumulated average, so you can get a more accurate idea of how far you will get based on your diving style. The current system is perfect.
- The steering wheel heating is easily accessible in your phone app to turn on before you get in, then turn off once you start driving. It will maintain its warmth until your body heat takes over. 
- The fan speed is hardly annoying. When you have music or something playing, you don't even notice it. Any aircon will keep blowing to maintain the required temp.
- Steering wheel centre is what it is, it looks like any other steering wheel comparative to VW, BMW etc. 
- Safety features can be turned off via buttons on the steering wheel and console by your seat, and if not located there, are not a problem to drive with.
- Cruise control shouldn't be used at higher speeds than 125kmh, you should be in full control at these speeds. I think they should lower that to 110kmh.
- You can use voice control to manage most of these things effortlessly. 
In a nutshell, everything you complain about can be addressed in OTA updates, and have been. I recommend you do a bit more diving into the cars abilities, as you have reviewed based on an uneducated seemingly biased approach.
